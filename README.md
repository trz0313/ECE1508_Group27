# CEMRI GAN
synthesis CEMRI using NCEMRI based on GAN models

step 1ï¼šmake you data list.
(1) process your onw data,it's best that paired NCEMRI and CEMI data keep on same path,as person1/NCEMRI and /person1/CEMRI.
(2) make your own data list by data_process.py, include the division of training set, validation set and test set. 


step 2: train!
(1) Put your data list path in the data_processing.py. 
(2) set own model save path or learning rate .
(3) select the training model in train.py and set trianing
(4) evaluate the trained model.
